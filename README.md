# RMiXCR
The RMiXCR package is user friendly R interface to diminish the required bioinformaic skils for using the [MiXCR](https://mixcr.readthedocs.io/en/master/) software in the TCR recognition.
It is mainly focused in their use in the analysis of RNAseq bulk samples, facilitating its installation and usability by minimizing the imputs parameters, thus providing transparency and reproducibility of the results.
